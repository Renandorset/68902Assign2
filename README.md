Difficulties and challenges encountered in carrying out the project.

Introduction
This is a mobile app project based on Kotlin language, it was developed for a movie website, which was very difficult to put together, but in the end it worked.

Challenges Faced

It was quite challenging to put together this project because the book had some sim-ilar examples, but at some points they weren't working as well as they should have.
Implementing the banks was very difficult at first, I needed to study and research a lot.

Errors
I was unable to manage the film data, it was giving operational errors when users selected unauthorized seats, and it was very difficult to get it right

Important learning

I improved my knowledge, did a lot of research and finally managed to deal with the film data efficiently and managed to fix the seat error, thus ensuring good use for the app user.

Conclusion
There were many challenges in creating this application, however, when I realized where I was tasked, I focused my efforts on where I would actually resolve the er-rors, so I was able to create an application that guarantees good use for the user.
